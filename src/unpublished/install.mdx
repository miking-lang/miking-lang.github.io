# Install Miking

We currently support two methods of installing Miking:

 1. Natively installed binary using the Opam package manager. (Mac, Linux)
 2. Pre-built Docker images with optional dependencies included. (Windows, Mac, Linux)

For basic usage of Miking with a limited set of dependencies, we recommend the
first option. If any of the extended Miking features are required, or if Opam
is not suitable for your system, then we recommend installing one of the Docker
images.

We also provide syntax highlighting for some of the popular editors. See the
[Install Syntax Highlighter](#install-syntax-highlighter) section for more
information.

## Native Install with Opam (Mac, Linux)

For native install, `opam` is required and `make` is highly
recommended.

:::info Install Opam

See the [Opam installation guide](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html) for
how to install Opam on Mac or on your Linux distribution:
[Link](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html)

:::

Create the Opam 5.0 switch:

```
opam update
opam switch create miking-ocaml 5.0.0~rc1
eval $(opam env)
```

Install required dependencies:

```
opam install dune linenoise
```

:::tip Optional Dependencies

Many features in the standard library will not work without these additional
dependencies. See the tab for your platform for more instructions.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="optdep-linux" label="Linux" default>

Install the dependencies with Opam:

```
opam install pyml toml lwt owl ocamlformat.0.24.1
```

Opam should invoke your distribution's package manager if there are any
additional dependencies needed.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="optdep-macos-x86" label="Mac (Intel x86)">

It might be necessary to add openblas to the pkg-config path if installed with
Homebrew. Replace `/usr/local` in the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` variable below with
your Homebrew prefix if they differ.

```bash
# Install openblas
brew install openblas

# Double check if /usr/local is what your Homebrew installation uses as its
# prefix. Change if it is different.
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/openblas/lib/pkgconfig:${PKG_CONFIG_PATH}"

# Now install the dependencies with Opam:
opam install pyml toml lwt owl ocamlformat.0.24.1
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="optdep-macos-arm64" label="Mac (Apple Silicon)">

Before installing the Opam packages, it is most likely necessary to perform
the following steps before proceeding with the installation:

```bash
# Install gcc and openblas
brew install gcc openblas

# Make sure that you have gcc as your cc compiler (change version from 12 to
# your GCC version if it is different)
cd $HOMEBREW_PREFIX/bin && ln -s gcc-12 cc
```

Now verify that your `cc` compiler points to the correct location by running
`which cc`. **You might need to open a new terminal window for this.**

Once `cc` points to the correct location, run the following commands to install
the remaining dependencies:

```bash
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/opt/openblas/lib/pkgconfig:${PKG_CONFIG_PATH}"
export OWL_CFLAGS="-g -O3 -Ofast -funroll-loops -ffast-math -DSFMT_MEXP=19937 -fno-strict-aliasing -Wno-tautological-constant-out-of-range-compare"
export OWL_AEOS_CFLAGS="-g -O3 -Ofast -funroll-loops -ffast-math -DSFMT_MEXP=19937 -fno-strict-aliasing"
export EIGENCPP_OPTFLAGS="-Ofast -funroll-loops -ffast-math"
export EIGEN_FLAGS="-O3 -Ofast -funroll-loops -ffast-math"

# If opened a new terminal window, make sure to run `eval $(opam env)` first

opam install pyml toml lwt owl ocamlformat.0.24.1
```

You can now remove the `cc` symlink created earlier.

:::

Clone the Miking git repository to a suitable location on your system and enter
the directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/miking-lang/miking.git
cd miking
```

If you do not have `git` installed on your system then you can manually
download a zip file with the source code from our GitHub page:
[https://github.com/miking-lang/miking/archive/refs/heads/develop.zip](https://github.com/miking-lang/miking/archive/refs/heads/develop.zip)

Assuming that you have downloaded the repository and are currently located in
that directory, then you can either install Miking on your system with `make`
or directly using your shell:

:::info Install Miking

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="mi-install-makefile" label="Makefile" default>

With `make` available, you can install Miking as:

```
make install
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="mi-install-shell" label="Shell">

If `make` is not available on your system, then you can directly install Miking
by running the provided `./make` shell script as:

```
./make boot && ./make install-boot && ./make && ./make install
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::

This will install the `mi` binary under `$HOME/.local/bin`, as well as the
standard library under `$HOME/.local/lib`. If not already, make sure that
`$HOME/.local/bin` is on your shell's PATH by running the following command
directly or adding it to the appropriate .rc-file (e.g. `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`):

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

## Install with Docker (Windows, Mac, Linux)

Before running the Docker image you must ensure that Docker is installed.

:::info Install Docker on Your Platform

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="docker-windows" label="Windows" default>
For Windows you will need to install the Docker Desktop application. See <a href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install">this page</a> for more info. After installing it will most likely ask you to install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) if you haven't already. This will require a restart of your computer.

With Docker Desktop installed and running, you should have access to the `docker` command from PowerShell.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="docker-mac" label="Mac">
For Mac you will need to install the Docker Desktop application. See <a href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install">this page</a> for more info. Make sure that you know if you are running an older Mac with Intel chip or a newer one with Apple Silicon (e.g. M1). Download the appropriate Docker Desktop release.

<b>Due to the current performance of Docker on Mac, we recommend using Opam if possible.</b>
</div>
Now install the CLI interface for Docker using <a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Installation">Homebrew</a>:

    brew install docker

Now you should be able to run Docker containers from the terminal through the `docker` command, given that the Docker Desktop application is running.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="docker-linux" label="Linux">
For Linux we recommend using Docker Engine. See <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install">this page</a> for more information about how to install Docker Engine for your Linux distribution.
<br /><br />
If using Arch Linux or one of its derivatives, follow the instructions on the Arch Wiki page (<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Docker">link</a>) instead.
<br /><br />

It is possible that your Docker Engine process is running with root privileges. **In this case you will need to run all commands below with `sudo` or add yourself to the docker group.** If unsure, try running a Docker command without `sudo` first.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::

Fetch the image by downloading it from Docker Hub:

```
docker pull mikinglang/miking
```

If you are in need of CUDA functionality, you can pull the CUDA image instead:

```
docker pull mikinglang/miking:latest-cuda
```

Both contain all dependencies necessary to use all features in the standard
library. If you however desire to use the GPU acceleration feature in Miking,
you should use the CUDA-based image.

:::caution

An executable built inside the Docker container should only be executed inside the Docker container.

:::

Now you can run the Docker image as:

```
docker run --rm -it mikinglang/miking bash
```

This will launch the miking Docker image with a bash shell where you have
access to the `mi` command. The standard Docker image is based on Alpine and
if additional features are desired within the Docker container such as an
editor then they can be installed with the `apk` package manager.

All dependencies necessary for rebuilding the Miking compiler is also included
in the Docker image should you wish to do any modifications. You will also find
the Miking source code under `/src/miking` included in the image.

### Example Launch Scripts

The entire Docker run command can be a bit cumbersome to type every time you
want to compile something with Miking. We recommend wrapping the Docker run
command in a script, for example:

:::note Docker Helper scripts

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="dockerlaunch-makefile" label="Makefile" default>

Using GNU Make to launch the image with `make run-docker`:

```makefile title="Makefile"
run-docker:
	$(eval IMAGE := mikinglang/miking:latest-alpine)
	$(eval CONTAINERNAME := hello-miking)
	$(eval PWD := $(shell pwd))
	docker run --name $(CONTAINERNAME)     \
	           --hostname $(CONTAINERNAME) \
	           --rm -it                    \
	           -v "$(PWD):/mnt:ro"         \
	           $(IMAGE) bash
```

This will mount the directory where the Makefile is located under `/mnt`. If
you also wish to write data to the same directory then this can be done by
removing the `:ro` part.

If you need to run Docker with `sudo`, then either prepend the `docker run`
in the Makefile rule with `sudo` or instead run `sudo make docker-run`.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="dockerlaunch-bash" label="Bash" default>

Using a Bash script launch the image with `./midock.sh`:

```bash title="midock.sh"
#!/usr/bin/env bash

IMAGE='mikinglang/miking:latest-alpine'
CONTAINERNAME='hello-miking'

# This can be used to help you specify relative directory to the Bash
# script itself.
RELDIR="$(cd "$(dirname "$BASH_SOURCE")" >/dev/null 2>&1; pwd)"

exec docker run --name ${CONTAINERNAME}     \
                --hostname ${CONTAINERNAME} \
                --rm -it                    \
                -v "$(pwd):/mnt:ro"         \
                ${IMAGE} bash
```

Make it executable by running `chmod +x midock.sh`.

This will mount the current directory when running the script under `/mnt` as
read-only. If you also wish to write data to the same directory then this can
be done by removing the `:ro` part. If you wish to mount the directory where
the Bash script is located then replace the `-v $(pwd):/mnt:ro` with
`-v "${RELDIR}:/mnt:ro"`.

If you need to run Docker with `sudo`, then either prepend the `docker run`
in the script with `sudo` or instead run `sudo ./midock.sh`.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="dockerlaunch-powershell" label="PowerShell" default>

In PowerShell on Windows, launch the image using the following script as
`.\midock.ps1`:

```powershell title="midock.ps1"
$Image = "mikinglang/miking:latest-alpine"
$ContainerName = "hello-miking"

# Mount Directory that you are running the script from
$MountDir = Get-Location

# Uncomment this to use the relative location to script instead
#$MountDir = $PSScriptRoot

docker run --rm -it `
           --name $ContainerName `
           --hostname $ContainerName `
           -v "${MountDir}:/mnt:ro" `
           $Image bash
```

This will mount the current directory when running the script under `/mnt` as
read-only. If you also wish to write data to the same directory then this can
be done by removing the `:ro` part. If you wish to mount the directory where
the PowerShell script is located then you can uncomment the line `$MountDir =
$PSScriptRoot`.
</TabItem>

:::

Here is an example MExpr program that you can use to verify your installation.
Save this as `fib.mc` and compile it with `mi compile fib.mc`. Try running it
as `./fib 50`.

```mc title="fib.mc"
/- These are from the Miking standard library -/
include "common.mc"
include "string.mc"

/- A string is a sequence of chars! -/
let s1: String = "foo"
let s2: [Char] = ['f', 'o', 'o']
utest s1 with s2

/- Fibonacci function -/
let fib = lam n.
  recursive let work = lam i. lam curr. lam next.
    if eqi i n then
      curr
    else
      work (addi i 1) next (addi curr next)
  in
  work 0 0 1

mexpr

if neqi (length argv) 2 then
  printLn (join ["usage: ", get argv 0, " N"]);
  exit 1
else -- continue

let printFib = lam n.
  printLn (join ["fib ", int2string n, " = ", int2string (fib n)])
in

loop (string2int (get argv 1)) printFib
```
