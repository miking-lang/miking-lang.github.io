# Miking Workshop 2022

**December 14, 2022, KTH Campus, Digital Futures Hub, Stockholm, Sweden**

![img alt](/img/background.jpg)

Welcome to the first Miking workshop! Miking is an open-source project developed at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology and is now released officially for the first time. The framework is a meta-language system for creating domain-specific languages and tools. Please see the [vision paper](https://people.kth.se/~dbro/papers/broman-2019-miking-vision.pdf), the [Miking webpage](https://miking.org/), or the [GitHub pages](https://github.com/miking-lang) for more information. In this first workshop, you will learn how to code with the Miking core language and how to create your own domain-specific language using the framework. There will be many interesting hands-on tutorials, technical talks, and research talks. Please bring your laptop!

The workshop is free of charge and includes lunch, coffee, and dinner. The format is hybrid, that is, it is possible to attend both in person, and online using Zoom. In both cases, you need to register (first come, first served). The workshop is organized together with Digital Futures. Several organizations have been funding research projects related to the Miking framework, including the Swedish research council (VR), the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (SSF), Vinnova, and Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP).
