\# Parser: Building a DocTree from a Source File   
  
This module defines a parser that reads a file and produces a \`DocTree\`,  
a hierarchical structure of tokens annotated with formatting state.    
See doc\-tree.mc for more information.  
  
\#\# General Idea  
The parser segments the code using a markup system: some keywords open new  
nodes in the tree, and other keywords close them.    
  
Example:  
\`\`\`miking  
let x = addi 3 8 in  
\`\`\`  
Here, \`let\` opens a new node \(a "let block"\). Later, when the parser  
encounters \`in\`, it recognizes it as a breaker for this block and closes it.  
  
The detection of opening words is handled here in the parser, while the  
decision of which breakers apply in the current context is delegated to  
breaker\-choosers.mc. This separation allows us to handle nested structures,  
language extensions, and special keywords without duplicating logic.  
  
\#\# Breaker Types  
When a breaker is encountered, three cases are possible:  
  
1. \*\*Local break\*\*    
   Only the current block is closed.    
   Example:    
   \`\`\`miking  
   lang A  
   end  
   \`\`\`    
   The keyword \`end\` closes only the \`lang\` block.  
  
2. \*\*Global break\*\*    
   The breaker closes the current block \*\*and one or more parent blocks\*\*.    
   Example:    
   \`\`\`miking  
   lang A  
       sem x = ...  
   end  
   \`\`\`    
   Here, \`end\` breaks both the \`sem\` and the \`lang\` block.  
   In this context, we also have to decides to which block \`lang\` belongs.  
  
3. \*\*Hard break\*\*    
   A new keyword forces a reinterpretation of the tree.    
   Example:    
   \`\`\`miking  
   let x = 1  
   let y = 2  
   lang A  
   end  
   \`\`\`    
   Initially, the second \`let\` is assumed to be nested \(\`let ... in\`\).  
   But encountering \`lang\` later reveals that \`let y = 2\` was actually  
   a \*\*top\-level let\*\*, so the parser restructures the tree to reflect this.  
   To handle this case a little bit tricky, we use back tracking with an accumlator.  
  
\#\# Includes  
Includes are handled through the IncludeSet API from the mast\-gen module.  
The parser first processes the include header of the file and recursively  
parses all included files. Each include is represented in the DocTree by  
an \`DocTreeIncludeNode\`, which may either contain the included file’s tree or be  
marked as already visited to prevent infinite loops.  
  
\#\# Result  
The final output is a \`DocTree\` for the entire project. This tree preserves  
block structure and include relationships
