# Miking Documentation

Miking is a meta-language system for creating embedded languages, and this site holds its documentation.

To get started, first [install Miking](/installation), then follow the [getting-started tutorial](./tutorials/getting-started.md) to learn about the core languages of Miking.

:::warning

We are currently in the process of restructuring our documentation (see [here](https://documentation.divio.com/) for more information on the intent), thus some information can be found in the first four categories below (where they should be) and some can be found under [old content](#old-content) below.

:::

## Content

- [Tutorials](./tutorials/index.md) are meant for initial learning, and give step-by-step instructions for solving small, self-contained tasks.
- [How-to guides](./how-to-guides/index.md) give step-by-step instructions on how to accomplish commonly occurring tasks or solve problems.
- The [Reference](./reference/index.md) documents the more technical details of the project: APIs, syntax, semantics, etc.
- [Explanations](./explanations/index.md) give more theoretical descriptions of concepts used in the Miking project, how they relate, and why they are designed the way they are.

## Old Content

The old documentation can be found here while the documentation restructuring is in progress:

- The [Miking](/miking-readme) README.
- The [Miking DPPL](/miking-dppl-readme) README.
